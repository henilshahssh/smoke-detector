<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT
## About The Project  -->
An IoT-based Smoke Detector System that detects smoke in the environment and provides real-time notifications. The system uses sensors to monitor air quality and alert users in case of dangerous levels of smoke as an indication of fire via buzzer. This project integrates hardware and software to ensure safety in both residential and industrial environments.

### Built With
* Arduino
* Smoke sensor
* Buzzer
* Flask
* HTML
* Python

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
 1. Connect the smoke sensor and buzzer to appropriate Arduino pins using wires in Arduino kit.
 2. Connect the Arduino to an USB computer port using cable provided in Arduino kit.
 3. Edit the python file to ensure the port to which Arduino is connected is specified correctly. 
 4. Run the python file on the same computer on which Arduino is connected.
 5. Now open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to access the flask app.
