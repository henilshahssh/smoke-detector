# Smoke Detector System

An IoT-based Smoke Detector System that detects smoke in the environment and provides real-time notifications. The system uses sensors (e.g., MQ-2 or similar smoke sensors) to monitor air quality and alert users in case of dangerous levels of smoke or fire risk. This project integrates hardware and software to ensure safety in residential or industrial environments.

## Features

- **Real-Time Smoke Detection**: Uses a smoke sensor to monitor air quality and detect hazardous levels of smoke.
- **Notification System**: Alerts users via an LED or buzzer in case of smoke detection.
- **Threshold Management**: Adjustable sensitivity for detecting smoke.
